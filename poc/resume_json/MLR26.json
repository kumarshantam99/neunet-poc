Produced a BLEU Score of 27.6 for 2 layers and 28.7 for 4 layer models comparable to the original paper.\nTook a sample of 100K sentences with BLEU score over 0.9 for Gender Bias analysis found that 30% of sentences have an error\nwith respect to gender.\nAmazon Dynamo-style key-value storage\nMar. 2019 to Mar. 2019\nDevised a simpli\u2022ed version of Amazon Dynamo in an android group messenger application for up to 5 nodes with an easily  scalable architecture.  Reproduced three features of Dynamo viz:- 1) Partitioning, 2) Replication, and 3) Failure handling.  Assured both availability and linearizability at the same time with a 99% success rate over-vigorous testing under multiple  failures and requests at a time.\nForensic pattern recognition using Explainable AI\nFeb. 2019 to Feb. 2019\nAnnotated a dataset of handmade features for a total of 13570 'AND' images consisting of 15 features.  Generated multiple PGM's from intuitive feature selection and hill-climbing made into Bayesian Models and Markov Models  using pgmpy in python.  Created a Siamese Neural Network to learn a representation of features from the 'and' images used to predict pairs using  patterns learnt from them. Achieved an accuracy of 74%  Built an AutoEncoder to learn the same pattern as in the Siamese Network so as to compare the accuracies using the same  'AND' image pairs. Achieved an accuracy of 91%.  Built a Multitask Learning (MTL) model to learn the mapping between \"AND\" images and handcrafted features, using the  AutoEncoder latent features and 15 Neural Networks customized to each di\u2022erent feature of the image.\nUnpaired Image-to-Image Translation with Conditional Adversarial Networks\nApr. 2019 to Apr. 2019\nImplemented CycleGAN Model to show emoji-style transfer between Apple<->Windows emoji style.  Assembled a 3 layer model with a Deep Convolution GAN, trained using the cyclic consistency loss with a CycleGAN  discriminator.  Trained and Tested with 2000 emojis of both styles using multiple settings obtaining signi\u2022cantly improved results over other  standard Generative Models\n!404 - An Information Retrieval System\nOct. 2018 to Nov. 2018\nDeployed a Full-Fledged Information Retrieval System as a part of a \u2022nal project for the subject Information Retrieval.  (https://youtu.be/u1SpF9V1lBY)  Worked in a group of 4.
